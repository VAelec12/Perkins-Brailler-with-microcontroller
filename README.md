# Perkins-Brailler-with-microcontroller
This repository will give a step by step process to develop a perkins brailler using microcontroller, both STM32 and 8051
The initial process is to get familiar with the microcontroller that you are using , incase of stm 32 which is a bit more complicated to get a hang of , we started with the basics:
1)explore the cube IDE and setup the initial conditions
2)Perform LED Blinking with STM 32 , configuring GPIO and IDR
3)Interface OLED/LCD 
4)Combine the two process together to get working model of perkins brailler
